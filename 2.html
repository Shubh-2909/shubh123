    <h1>Expectation vs Reality in College</h1>
    <p>College life can be quite different from what you expect. In this website, we'll explore the expectations and realities of college life, covering topics such as academics, social life, finances, and housing.</p>

    <h2>Academics</h2>
    <p>Expectation: College will be easy and stress-free. You'll have plenty of free time to pursue your interests and hobbies.</p>
    <p>Reality: College can be challenging, especially if you're taking tough courses. You may also find yourself spending long hours studying, especially during midterms and finals.</p>

    <h2>Social Life</h2>
    <p>Expectation: You'll make a lot of new friends, attend parties and have a great time.</p>
    <p>Reality: Making new friends takes time, and it can be difficult to fit in and find your social circle. You may also find that your social life is not as active as you'd like, especially if you're not involved in extracurricular activities or clubs.</p>

    <h2>Finances</h2>
    <p>Expectation: You'll have plenty of money to spend on fun activities and going out with friends.</p>
    <p>Reality: College is expensive, and you may find yourself struggling to make ends meet. You'll need to budget your money carefully and find ways to save.</p>

    <h2>Housing</h2>
    <p>Expectation: You'll have a comfortable and spacious room with all the amenities you need.</p>
    <p>Reality: Rooms are cramped and uncomfortable, and we may have to deal with noisy roommates.</p>
